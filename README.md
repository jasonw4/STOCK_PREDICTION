# STOCK_PREDICTION
BostonHacks Project

## Inspiration
We wanted to make something that fit in with the "Innovating with AI" track. This stock predictor will help investors manage their risk when it comes to long term investments. Also, the massage gun would save my back pain from CS 237, and CS 330 in the future.

## What it does
This product predicts the future of stocks using trends from the past and predicts how much the stock will vary.

## How we built it
We used Streamlit, Yahoo Finance, and Facebook Prophet for graphing and getting data.

## Challenges we ran into 
We were not sure where to get the information.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
Making a hackathon project.

## What we learned 
Stocks are hard to predict, even with computer data.

## What's next for Dow Jones Stock Predictor 
Getting massaged with the massage gun.
